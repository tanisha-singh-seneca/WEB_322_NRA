                        The meal that makes me happy is fried chicken and sprite. I love listening to music, and the genre I follow and 
                        listen to the most is k-pop. My top 4 k-pop groups are BTS, SEVENTEEN, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, and ENHYPEN, all 
                        are boy groups. I love drawing, pencil sketching, and doing calligraphy. Currently, I'm enrolled into CPP 
                        (Computer Programming), which is a 2-year (4 semester) diploma program, at Seneca College (Newnham Campus), and 
                        I'm already in my third semester.
